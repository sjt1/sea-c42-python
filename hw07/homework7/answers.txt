Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.3

Problem 3:

I recieved the following output: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "dna_analysis.py", line 38, in <module>
    linenum = linenum + 1
NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined

This error was triggered because the program could not run the for loop 
that requires the variable 'lineum' to have a set value.  The loop had 
nowhere to begin because it is dependent upon lineum's initial value
in order to begin the loop and keep track of the current line.  The loop 
also requires an initial value for 'seq' in order to begin keeping
track of the nucleotides in the file that have already been read.

If 'gc_count = 0' is commented out the loop 'for bp in seq:' cannot keep
track of the number of G and C nucleotides because the variable gc_count
has not yet been defined and therefore cannot be used or incremented.
